            Claxified has always had community at its heart. our aim was to build a community where people like them could find
            everything they needed to settle into a new city, job, place to
            live, and some furniture to fill their place. What we created was
            the online classifieds platform in India, space where people
            could come together to help each other out in small ways.

            In order to protect the security of your account, it’s important to
            be able to recognize phishing attempts and spoof sites. Phishing is
            a term used when fraudsters try to gain access to personal account
            logins. Spoofs are websites or emails that attempt to mimic a
            particular company in order to trick users into providing their
            information. Most phishing attempts come in the form of spoof sites
            or emails.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Spotting a Phishing Attempt:</h4>
          <p>
            Fraudsters go to great lengths to mimic real companies. They can use
            logos, similar email addresses, and even the names of employees to
            appear more realistic. Learning to spot phishing attempts comes down
            to recognising when you are dealing with the true organization, and
            when it may be a spoof. Here a few key signs to watch out for:
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Alarmist statements</h4>
          <p>
            In an attempt to get users to act quickly, fraudsters often start
            messages with urgent claims such as ‘Your Account has been disabled.
            Change your password now to regain access or it will be deleted.’
            These can also be positive statements, such as ‘You’ve qualified for
            a discount! Confirm your account information now to receive free
            features!’
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Asking for confidential Information</h4>
          <p>
            In order to gain access to your accounts, fraudsters ask for
            passwords, bank accounts, or credit card information. Our team will
            never request this type of personal account information over email.
            We will also never send password reset emails unless you’ve
            specifically requested one through the ‘Forgot your password?’
            button on the Claxified login page.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Bad Spelling and Grammar</h4>
          <p>
            Many phishing attempts come from overseas, and often use odd
            phrasing, incorrect spelling or bad grammar.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Suspicious Email Addresses</h4>
          <p>
            Legitimate Claxified emails will come from @info.Claxified.com or
            @Claxified.com email addresses. Don’t be fooled by emails such as
            Claxifiedsupport@hotmail.com or security@Claxified.support.com

            Sometimes you might need to pay a fee to get your ad where you want
            it. The amount depends on:
          </p>
          <p>- whether you’re posting as a private individual or a business</p>
          <p>- the category you’re posting in</p>
          <p>
            You can also pay to make your ad work harder. Our features help you
            jump to the top of the listings, speed up your sale, or reach out
            further to your audience. They’re available in every category. Just
            pick and choose to suit your needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            To keep the price down, you can trial your ad without features to
            see how you get on. Add them at a later date if you think your ad
            needs more boost.
          </p>
          <br />
